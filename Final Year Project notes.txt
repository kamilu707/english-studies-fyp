<h2> English is the programming language <h2>

If programming requires knowledge of human languages, then the main language to know is, without question, English. The codebases for nearly every major programming language, library and API are written with variable names, comments, and documentation in English. If a coder is stuck on a tricky problem, the best way to get help is to search in English or post questions in English. Then there is the fact that big tech companies, Apple included, have employees from all over the world, who usually communicate in the lingua franca of English. The best way to become is a good programmer is to read good code, and to read the best code in the world, you have to know English.
